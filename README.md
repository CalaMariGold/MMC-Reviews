The ultimate destination for community-driven reviews of Minecraft mods and modpacks.

### This GitHub primarily serves as a way to report bugs and request features.

### I’m a web developer, how can I contribute?
That’s really exciting to hear! MMC Reviews runs WordPress as its CMS, which uses MySQL for its database. I (CalaMariGold) frequently use PHP and JavaScript in custom scripts for MMCR. Much of this site is powered by WordPress plugins, many of which are open source. The main plugins we use for the bulk of the site are listed here:

[Site Reviews](https://github.com/pryley/site-reviews/tree/develop) (actively in development. responsible for all aspects of reviews, ratings, and rating filtering)

[Gravity Forms](https://github.com/pronamic/gravityforms) (request a project and submit an edit forms)

[FacetWP](https://github.com/FacetWP), [Advanced Custom Fields](https://github.com/AdvancedCustomFields/acf) (filtering, tags, taxonomies, etc)

[Astra Theme](https://wpastra.com/) (structure and design of the site)

If you’re interested in helping out with development, please reach out to me on our Discord!
